# DevLog: Escape App - Main Features UI Implementation

## 1. Conceptual Plan

### What We Want to Achieve
After successfully completing the onboarding experience, we're now building the core UI components that will form the heart of the Escape app. These features work together to create a comprehensive support system for users on their journey toward spiritual purity and overcoming temptations.

### The Seven Core Features
1. **Streak Counter** - A prominent, motivating display of consecutive clean days
2. **Prayer Tracker (Salah)** - Simple binary tracking of completed/missed prayers
3. **Challenges System** - Gamified achievement system with badges, cards, levels, and stars
4. **Emergency Section** - Crisis intervention tools with emergency contacts and helpful tips
5. **Relapse Recording** - Honest tracking system for setbacks with historical data
6. **Analytics Dashboard** - Visual graphs and insights into progress patterns
7. **Media Section** - Community-building content with blogs, articles, and videos

### Why This Matters
These features create a complete ecosystem of support, motivation, accountability, and community. The streak counter provides daily motivation, prayer tracking reinforces spiritual discipline, challenges gamify progress, emergency tools provide immediate help during temptation, relapse recording maintains honesty, analytics show patterns, and media builds community connection.

### UI Philosophy
We're maintaining our UI-First Architecture and Atomic Design approach, creating beautiful, intuitive interfaces that guide users naturally through their recovery journey without overwhelming them with complex interactions.

## 2. Codebase Review

### Current State Analysis
- ✅ **Onboarding Feature**: Complete UI implementation (Alhamdulillah!)
- **Project Structure**: Following atomic design methodology
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation bar with home page as primary screen
- **Theme System**: Established design tokens and components
- **State Management**: TBD (UI-only focus for now)

### Key Integration Points
- **Home Page**: Primary container for streak counter and navigation to other features
- **Bottom Navigation**: Access points to main feature sections
- **Shared Components**: Reusable atoms and molecules across features
