1. Latest date streak count is the algorithm ✅
2. The modal is messed up: use ListView or SingleChildScrollView ✅
3. Chips look super bad, their outlines ajeeb. They should be light grey ✅
4. Capital Letters look super bad ✅
5. Text not in center of buttons, buttons are neomorphic, why not create our own button just like the emergency button? ✅
5. Submit might not be nice word. Use "Save" instead! ✅
6. Undoing relapse should be very simple. We delete today's streak object. Streak model should have a relapse flag to track whether it was relapse or not. Or maybe just a success flag could be enough. True would mean success and false would mean relapse. ✅

1. Quick stats ✅
2. Create UserProfile, store onboarding information inside UserProfile
3. Store goal information inside UserProfile
4. Create goal provider
5. Whenever creating Streak object in database, the goal will always come from goal provider, inShaaAllah
6. Quick stats can listen to goal provider, current streak watcher can be removed, inShaaAllah
