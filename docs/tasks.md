1. Latest date streak count is the algorithm ✅
2. The modal is messed up: use ListView or SingleChildScrollView ✅
3. Chips look super bad, their outlines ajeeb. They should be light grey ✅
4. Capital Letters look super bad ✅
5. Text not in center of buttons, buttons are neomorphic, why not create our own button just like the emergency button? ✅
5. Submit might not be nice word. Use "Save" instead! ✅
6. Undoing relapse should be very simple. We delete today's streak object. Streak model should have a relapse flag to track whether it was relapse or not. Or maybe just a success flag could be enough. True would mean success and false would mean relapse. ✅
